# Responsive Tasks

1. Implement a 'wrapper' class that holds content to a maximum of 1200px wide and is centered.

2. Implement the following responsiveness in the page:

  **Breakpoints**: (mobile) 600px (tablet) 1200px (desktop)
  All gaps between items will be 1em;

  1. Goth news: stacked on mobile; 2 across on tablet; 4 across on desktop
  2. Furry news: stacked on mobile; 2 across on tablet; 3 across on desktop
  
  (don't forget the wrap and the calc for the width to take the gap into account)

3. Implement your own sub-culture news section. Make it 3 across on tablet; 5 across on desktop (I don't mind about dummy content!)

4. Implement a dark-theme (and ensure that you can test it!)

5. Implement a print stylesheet

6. Make the header sticky

7. **BONUS**: Make the typography sizes adjust to screen-size
